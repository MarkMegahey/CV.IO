                <h4>Netshell LTD</h4>
                <h4>Software Engineer</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                  I began working for Netshell Ltd in 2019 around June, I had a 3 month trial period
				          where I began learning about the companies various projects, at first I was asked to
				          fix bugs for a lottery based mobile application written in xamarin (IOS/Android Hybrid
                <br>
                <br>
        				  To the shock of my at the time boss I was able to resolve all the bug tickets given to me
        				  within my first week due to my previous knowledge in C# desktop applications.
                <br>
                <br>
                  Some time after the trial period was over I was moved onto the Unibet Sportbook Betting Project,
        				  the project was a reactJS/Redux frontend supported by a Java backend.
        				<br>
                <br>
        				  Overall I spent around 4-5 month working on the backend writeing java funtionality and around 1 year 4-5 months
        				  on the frontend writing features and bug fixes in reactJS/Redux.
        				<br>
                <br>
        				  This was at first a difficult task given I had zero experience or knowledge in java and very little to no react
        				  experience aswell, however this was not the first time I had been in a position where I would have to learn an
        				  entire new langauge/framework.
                <br>
                <br>
                  During my time at Netshell I had to interact with many langauges and frameworks including but
                  not limited to.

                <p>
                  I began working for Smart Driver Club Ltd in 2017 around April, I had a 4 week trial period
                  where they gave me some test applications to work on. These test application ended up being used
                  for everyday buisness and are still used today.
                <br>
                <br>
                  After my trial period had finished I was assigned to work on the companies internal management tools.
                <br>
                <br>
                  My main area of work was a C# Wpf application that would allow the members of the company to interact
                  with customer data via a friendly user interface. This involved writing and testing MySql Store Procedures,
                  adding new features and maintaining the current code.

                <br>

                  Over the last year I have also spent some time working on a online community based
                  within the Discord Communication System and based around internet entertainment and
                  live streaming.
                <br>
                <br>
                  Discord is a server based message forum where communities can congregate to discuss
                  and share knowledge and experience, the particular community that I work alongside is
                  built around live streaming and the constant improvement in stream quality and content.
                <br>
                <br>
                  I have used my C# and .Net Skillsets to build an asynchronous bot hosted within the discord
                  to allow community staff to handle member applications for advancement within the community
                  amoung other things.
                <br>
                <br>
                  The work I have done regarding this community is my own personal project and has required me to
                  use the following tech.

                <h4>Junior Developer</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                  As the company began to grow, I was offered a full time position as a junior developer.
                  My responsibilities increased and I was required to direct my own learning and produce
                  independent work for Indeeâ€™s clients without the same level of direct guidance.
                <br>
                <br>
                  One of the biggest challenges I had to face was the transition from a centralized team
                  to a decentralised remote one. This came with it many new problems and many new practises
                  that I had to learn.
                <br>
                <br>
                  On several occasions I was given the opportunity to lead a project and as a result of that
                  was presented, on a few occasions, with needing to meet the clients face-to-face independently.
                  This taught me a lot of valuable communication skills, including how to organise and run a meeting,
                  how to manage expense claims through an accounting system, how to negotiate on expectations and
                  how to feedback to management.

                <br>
                <p>
                  During this period, I was working with Indee on a freelance basis,
                  this was very much a training role and I was given guidance and resources
                  to develop my skills in web / web application development.
                <br>
                <br>
                  I had to use these new skills to solve problems for Indeeâ€™s clients,
                  this included tasks ranging from creating simple web pages to much more
                  complex interfaces for custom applications.
                <br>
                <br>
                  It was in this role that I gained most of my foundation in programming
                  knowledge and acquired core skill sets; including teamwork, time management
                  and a deeper understanding / experience of Customer Service.
                <br>
                <br>
                  I also was able to greatly improve my literacy skills, this had a direct
                  benefit to the quality of communication I was having with both the team and the clients.
                  During my time at this level, I mostly worked under the supervision of the
                  company director in the companyâ€™s office.
