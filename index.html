            <h4>Apprentice Developer</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
              During this period, I was working with Indee on a freelance basis,
              this was very much a training role and I was given guidance and resources
              to develop my skills in web and web application development.
            <br>
            <br>
              I had to use these new skills to solve problems for Indee’s clients,
              this included tasks ranging from creating simple web pages to much more
              complex interfaces for custom applications.
            <br>
            <br>
              It was in this role that I gained most of my foundation in programming
              knowledge and acquired core skill sets; including teamwork, time management
              and a deeper understanding / experience of Customer Service.
            <br>
            <br>
              I also was able to greatly improve my literacy skills, this had a direct
              benefit to the quality of communication I was having with both the team and the clients.
              During my time at this level, I mostly worked under the supervision of the
              company director in the company’s office.

            <h4>Junior Developer</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
              As the company began to grow, I was offered a full time position as a junior developer.
              My responsibilities increased and I was required to direct my own learning and produce
              independent work for Indee’s clients without the same level of direct guidance.
            <br>
            <br>
              One of the biggest challenges I had to face was the transition from a centralized team
              to a decentralised remote one. This came with it many new problems and many new practises
              that I had to learn.
            <br>
            <br>
              On several occasions I was given the opportunity to lead a project and as a result of that
              was presented, on a few occasions, with needing to meet the clients face-to-face independently.
              This taught me a lot of valuable communication skills, including how to organise and run a meeting,
              how to manage expense claims through an accounting system, how to negotiate on expectations and
              how to feedback to management.
