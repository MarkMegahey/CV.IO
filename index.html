                <h4>Apprentice Developer</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                  During this period, I was working with Indee on a freelance basis,
                  this was very much a training role and I was given guidance and resources
                  to develop my skills in web and web application development.
                <br>
                <br>
                  I had to use these new skills to solve problems for Indee’s clients,
                  this included tasks ranging from creating simple web pages to much more
                  complex interfaces for custom applications.
                <br>
                <br>
                  It was in this role that I gained most of my foundation in programming
                  knowledge and acquired core skill sets; including teamwork, time management
                  and a deeper understanding / experience of Customer Service.
                <br>
                <br>
                  I also was able to greatly improve my literacy skills, this had a direct
                  benefit to the quality of communication I was having with both the team and the clients.
                  During my time at this level, I mostly worked under the supervision of the
                  company director in the company’s office.

                <br>
                <p>
                  As the company began to grow, I was offered a full time position as a junior developer.
                  My responsibilities increased and I was required to direct my own learning and produce
                  independent work for Indee’s clients without the same level of direct guidance.
                <br>
                <br>
                  One of the biggest challenges I had to face was the transition from a centralized team
                  to a decentralised remote one. This came with it many new problems and many new practises
                  that I had to learn.
                <br>
                <br>
                  On several occasions I was given the opportunity to lead a project and as a result of that
                  was presented, on a few occasions, with needing to meet the clients face-to-face independently.
                  This taught me a lot of valuable communication skills, including how to organise and run a meeting,
                  how to manage expense claims through an accounting system, how to negotiate on expectations and
                  how to feedback to management.
